Here I need to implement an application for analyzing signatures of arbitrary files. This signature allows to define file content type and consists of a set of "magic numbers." These numbers are usually located in the beginning of the file. 
I need to implement an application that accepts the signatures.txt as an input. It contains a list of file types and their respective signatures in the HEX format.
